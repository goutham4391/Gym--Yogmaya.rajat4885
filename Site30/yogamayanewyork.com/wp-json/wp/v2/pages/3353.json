If you do not show up for a class you reserved it will be considered a &#8220;No-Show&#8221; and the class will be debited from your account. Classes canceled prior to the 12-hr Late Cancel window are considered &#8220;Early Cancel&#8221; and will be returned to your account to use within the valid period of your expiration date. Exceptions will not be made.<\/p>\n<p>Please arrive in a reasonable amount of time before your scheduled class or workshop start time. Entrance may be refused 5 minutes after the start time and, if a class or workshop is sold out, spaces may be given to those on the wait list 3 minutes before the start time and entrance refused to any student arriving after that time.  <\/p>\n<p><u>Workshops and Special Events<\/u>: Workshops and special events must be cancelled 48-hours before the start time.\u00a0 In the case of multi-session workshops and events, cancellation must be made 48-hours before the start time of the first session.\u00a0 No full or partial refunds will be given after that time.\u00a0 Certain workshops are non-refundable, and this is noted in the description. Please refer to our Arrival Policy.<\/p>\n<p><u>Retreats<\/u>: All retreats have a non-refundable deposit to secure your spot.  All retreats have their own specific Balance Due Terms, Cancellation Terms, Liability Waivers, and General T&#038;Cs. You can request any information not already provided on the website, including the Liability Waiver and T&#038;Cs, prior to making your non-refundable deposit. Or, if you have already made your deposit one will be sent to you. The Liability Waiver and T&#038;Cs must be read, signed, and returned to the retreat leader within a few days of making your deposit.  Failure to sign the contract does not release you from the terms of the retreat, including the terms of our non-refundable deposits and retreat cancellation policies.  <\/p>\n<p><u>Schedule Change Policy<\/u>: While we do our best to communicate changes in advance, please note that Yogamaya reserves the right to make schedule changes at any time, including without notice, and extraordinary refunds will not be given for services that occur, including instances when the teacher is substituted or decision is made to deliver the service online through a video conferencing, streaming or rental service of Yogamaya&#8217;s choosing.<\/p>\n<p><u>Teacher Training<\/u>: Please refer to the Student Agreement and Tuition Contract that you agreed to upon submitting your online application.<\/p>\n<p><u>Private Mat Storage<\/u>: Is available on a monthly recurring payment for a specific price. We reserve the right to donate mats left in our private storage area for non-payment within 1 week of non-payment.<\/p>\n<p><u>Monthly Recurring Memberships<\/u>: Monthly recurring memberships will recur forever unless canceled by the student through your dashboard.\u00a0 You agree to be charged by auto-payment every 30-days and understand that any unused class credits will not transfer to a future pay cycle. Just like Netflix, once you cancel you still have access through the end of your pay cycle. No refunds, no transfers, no carry-over class credits.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yogamaya Terms &amp; Conditions General Purchase Information:\u00a0You have purchased a service that will be delivered\u00a0to you either \u201cIn-Studio\u201d or online&#8230;  <a class=\"excerpt-read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/yogamayanewyork.com\/terms-conditions\/\" title=\"Read Terms &#038; Conditions\">Read Article<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2426,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Terms &amp; Conditions - Yogamaya<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/yogamayanewyork.com\/terms-conditions\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Terms &amp; Conditions - Yogamaya\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Yogamaya Terms &amp; Conditions General Purchase Information:\u00a0You have purchased a service that will be delivered\u00a0to you either \u201cIn-Studio\u201d or online...
